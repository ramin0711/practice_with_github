Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

hmm, because I may not want my codes to be updated just yet,and might need to wait to see what has happen before I pull it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is for clone from github to github repos. Clone is for local to local or github to local. Branch is adding 
a local branch or an online branch to your repo.
